html basics:
HTML means "Hypertext Markup Language"
HTML is the structure of websites.
HTMl files can be created with Text editors like Notepad.
We will use notepad for our project
project no.1:My first web page
1.Open notepad(or text editor used)
2.type <!Doctype html>
3.Type <html>. this will be the start of our code.
4.type <head> and click enter 2 times.Head is the part of the HTMl that cannot be seen on the web page. But titles can work inside Head
5.Type </head>
6.in between <head> and</head> type <title>
7.Type the title of the Tab (e.g. My website)and after that type </title>
8.type <body> after </head>
9.Type <p> And put any text you want then type </p>
10.type</body> and then type </html> at the end.
11.It should look like this.
<!Doctype html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Title of the tab</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>Random text</p>
</body>
</html>.
